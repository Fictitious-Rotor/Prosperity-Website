This is a comprehensive list of all server mods, datapacks, and relevant configurations, along with an explanation of each feature and why it was added.

# Client mods

You can join the server using a vanilla client, or with whatever mods you wish. However, if you wish to use some server features you will need to download mods for your client. Note that there are several additional mods we recommend, which you can find [here](new-player-guide/#mods--useful-tools).

If you are looking to see if the mod you want to use is allowed on the server, check out [this page](allowed-mods).

# Mods

Relevant configs can be found [here](#configs), if you wish to test in singleplayer or download the world. Specific Carpet features can be found [here](#carpet-features).
